# DriveSafe AI: Driver Monitoring System

A real-time drowsiness detection system utilizing deep learning and computer vision to enhance road safety. The system identifies whether a driver's eyes are open or closed and triggers an alert if drowsiness is detected.

## 🚀 Features

Real-time monitoring using a webcam.
AI-driven eye state classification (Open/Closed) based on a fine-tuned MobileNetV2 model.
Audio alert system to warn drivers in case of detected drowsiness.
Flask web application for seamless integration and user interface.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Python: Backend logic and integration.
* TensorFlow: Deep learning framework for model training and inference.
* Flask: Web framework for real-time video streaming.
* OpenCV: Image processing and video frame capture.
* Pygame: Audio playback for the alert system.
* TensorFlow Hub: Pre-trained model for transfer learning.

## ⚙️ Installation

**Prerequisites**

* Python 3.7 or above
* Virtual environment setup (optional but recommended)

Steps

1. Clone the repository:

bash

Copy code

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/drowsiness-detection-system.git  
cd drowsiness-detection-system  

2. Install dependencies:

bash

Copy code

pip install -r requirements.txt  

3. Place your trained model in the /model directory (update the file path in app.py if needed).

4. Place the audio alert file (alarm.wav) in the /sounds directory.

## Usage

1. Run the Flask application:

bash

Copy code

python app.py

Open a web browser and navigate to:

2. Open a web browser and navigate to:

Copy code

http://127.0.0.1:5000/ 

Allow access to your webcam, and the application will start monitoring your eyes.
